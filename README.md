Dog Feeder Station 🐕🐾
This was a DIY project that was made by myself and my father in law to keep our dog happy and healthy!🙂
It has an Arduino mega controlling a 12Vdc linear actuator with integrated limit switches to control the position of the actuator for an accurate dosage.
There is also a custom interface IO board that contains an RTC ds1307 outputting all the data to a 2.8’’ lcd touch screen HMI.
Main Features: 
- Ability to create a schedule that can give up to 2 doses per day, based on the times selected from the HMI. 
- Dose counter with time stamp available to monitor if the dog is being fed as it should.
- Alarm buzzer that indicates if any error is active to catch human attention to ensure the dog is always fed
- Adjustable internal parameters from the HMI for the user to control the feeding sequence in a more reliable and accurate way, ensuring the right amount of food for the dog.
Testing phase has been completed where all criteria was met in the end, however, some hiccups in the way that had to be overcome.
Dog is finally happy with his new food dispenser toy!🙂
